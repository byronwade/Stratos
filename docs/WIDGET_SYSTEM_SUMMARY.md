## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Property Intelligence Widget ⭐

**The game-changer for contractors:**

Shows enriched property data from external APIs:
- Property details (sq ft, year built, lot size, bedrooms/bathrooms)
- **Ownership history** (owner name, sale dates, sale prices)
- **Valuation data** (assessed value, market value, tax amounts)
- **Historical permits** (CRITICAL for contractors - know what work has been done!)
- **Risk factors** (flood zones, earthquake zones, fire zones)
- **Utilities** (electric, gas, water, sewer providers)

**Why this matters:**
- Know if property is owner-occupied (affects pricing)
- See recent permits to avoid duplicate work
- Understand property value for quotes
- Identify risk factors for insurance

### 2. Industry-Specific Presets

**8 pre-configured layouts** optimized for different trades:

| Industry | Focus | Key Widgets |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| HVAC | Equipment, sizing | HVAC Equipment, Property Intelligence |
| Plumbing | Fixtures, permits | Plumbing Fixtures, Permits, Materials |
| Electrical | Panels, circuits | Electrical Panels, Permits, Property |
| Roofing | Materials, photos | Roofing Materials, Photo Gallery |
| Landscaping | Zones, location | Landscape Zones, Location Map |
| General Contractor | Comprehensive | All key widgets |
| Remodeling | Photos, changes | Photo Gallery, Change Orders |
| Commercial | Project mgmt | Schedule, Teams, Purchase Orders |

**Why this matters:**
- Each trade gets exactly what they need
- No wasted screen space
- Optimized workflows out of the box

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Customization

Users can:
- ✅ Drag widgets to reposition
- ✅ Add new widgets from library
- ✅ Remove unwanted widgets
- ✅ Collapse widgets to save space
- ✅ Switch between presets instantly
- ✅ Reset to defaults

**Why this matters:**
- Every business works differently
- No "one-size-fits-all" limitations
- Users can optimize for their workflow

### 4. Persistent Layouts

Layouts automatically save to localStorage:
- Survives page refreshes
- Works offline
- Per-user customization (when auth is added)

**Why this matters:**
- Set it once, use forever
- No need to reconfigure every time
- Team members can share layouts (future feature)

## 🎯 What Makes This Smart

### For Different Industries

**Commercial vs Residential:**
- Commercial: More focus on permits, teams, purchase orders
- Residential: More focus on customer communication, photos

**HVAC vs Plumbing vs Electrical:**
- Each has industry-specific widgets (equipment, fixtures, panels)
- Different permit requirements
- Different property intelligence needs

**Service vs Installation vs Remodeling:**
- Service: Quick financials, customer info
- Installation: Equipment specs, permits, costing
- Remodeling: Before/after photos, change orders

### Smart Defaults

Each preset is carefully designed based on:
- ✅ What contractors check most frequently
- ✅ What drives business decisions
- ✅ What saves time on every job
- ✅ What prevents costly mistakes

### Flexibility

The system is smart because it:
- ✅ Provides intelligent defaults (presets)
- ✅ Allows complete customization (add/remove/rearrange)
- ✅ Learns from usage (can track which widgets are most used)
- ✅ Adapts to any trade (35+ widgets to choose from)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Test the new page
Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/work/1

# 2. Try customization
Click "Customize Layout" → Add widgets → Drag to reposition

# 3. Try presets
Click "Presets" → Select "HVAC Contractor" → See layout change

# 4. Enable property enrichment (optional)
# Add to .env.local:
ATTOM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Replace Old Page (When Ready)

```bash
# Backup old page
mv src/app/.../work/[id]/page.tsx src/app/.../work/[id]/page-old.tsx

# Activate new page
mv src/app/.../work/[id]/page-new.tsx src/app/.../work/[id]/page.tsx
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Architecture Highlights

**Server Components First:**
- Widget grid and containers are Server Components where possible
- Only interactive parts are Client Components
- Reduces JavaScript bundle size

**State Management:**
- ✅ Zustand (NOT React Context - per project rules)
- ✅ Persistent storage (localStorage)
- ✅ Shallow selectors (prevents unnecessary re-renders)
- ✅ DevTools integration

**Performance:**
- ✅ Property data cached for 7 days
- ✅ Debounced drag handlers
- ✅ Lazy-loaded widgets (future enhancement)
- ✅ Optimized grid layout (CSS Grid)

**Security:**
- ✅ API keys in environment variables
- ✅ Server-side API calls only
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Error handling

### Dependencies Installed

```bash
✅ @dnd-kit/core
✅ @dnd-kit/sortable
✅ @dnd-kit/utilities
✅ @dnd-kit/modifiers
```

All required UI components already exist (dialog, sheet, switch, etc.)

## 🎨 Customization Examples

### Add a Custom Widget

```typescript
// 1. Create widget component
export function MyWidget({ job }) {
  return <div>My custom content</div>;
}

// 2. Add to WIDGET_METADATA
"my-widget": {
  title: "My Widget",
  description: "Shows my data",
  defaultSize: { width: 2, height: 2 },
  category: "custom",
  industries: ["all"],
}

// 3. Register in renderer
case "my-widget":
  return <MyWidget job={job} />;
```

### Create a Custom Preset

```typescript
export const myPreset: LayoutPreset = {
  id: "my-preset",
  name: "My Custom Layout",
  industry: "custom",
  widgets: [
    createWidget("header", "job-header", "Header", 0, 0, 4, 1),
    createWidget("my-widget", "my-widget", "My Widget", 0, 1, 2, 2),
    // ... add more widgets
  ],
};
```
