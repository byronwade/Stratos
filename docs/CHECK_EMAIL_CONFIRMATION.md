# Check Email Confirmation Settings

## The Issue

You successfully signed up, but there's no session. This happens when **email confirmation is enabled** in Supabase.

## Quick Fix: Disable Email Confirmation (For Testing)

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation (Recommended for development)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/togejqdwggezkxahomeh/auth/providers
2. Scroll down to **Email** section
3. Find "**Confirm email**" toggle
4. **Turn it OFF** (disable it)
5. Click "**Save**"

Now try signing up again - you should be auto-logged in!

### Option 2: Keep Email Confirmation (Production setup)

If you want to keep email confirmation enabled:

1. Check your email inbox (the email you signed up with)
2. Look for confirmation email from Supabase
3. Click the confirmation link
4. You'll be redirected and logged in

**Note**: In development, Supabase sends real emails, so check:
- Inbox
- Spam folder
- Promotions tab (Gmail)

## What Happened

When you signed up:
1. ✅ User was created in Supabase
2. ✅ Confirmation email was sent
3. ❌ But no session was created (waiting for email confirmation)
4. ❌ UI didn't show the "check your email" message (bug we need to fix)

## After You Disable Email Confirmation

Try signing up with a new email (or the same one) and you should:
1. ✅ Be automatically redirected to /dashboard
2. ✅ See your user avatar in the header
3. ✅ Be fully logged in

## Quick Check: Is Email Confirmation Enabled?

Run this command to check your Supabase project settings:

```bash
# This will show if email confirmation is required
curl -X GET 'https://togejqdwggezkxahomeh.supabase.co/auth/v1/settings' \
  -H "apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InRvZ2VqcWR3Z2dlemt4YWhvbWVoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NjE3MjAyOTUsImV4cCI6MjA3NzI5NjI5NX0.a74QOxiIcxeALZsTsNXNDiOls1MZDsFfyGFq992eBBM" \
  | jq '.email_confirm_enabled'
```

If it returns `true`, that's why you're not being logged in automatically.
